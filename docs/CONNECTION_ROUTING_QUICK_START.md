# Connection Routing - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What's New

Your app now has a **professional connection routing system** that allows you to configure how the AI chooses which connection to use based on caller intent.

## ✨ How to Use

### 1. **Click Any Connection (Edge)**
- Simply **click on any arrow/line** connecting two nodes in your workflow
- A beautiful, professional panel will open
- You'll see a helpful hint at the bottom if you have connections but haven't clicked one yet

### 2. **Configure the Connection**
The panel has 4 organized tabs:

#### 📋 **Basic Info Tab**
- Set the connection name
- Enable/disable the connection
- Set priority (higher = preferred when scores are equal)
- Define the purpose

#### 🎯 **Routing Rules Tab** (Most Important!)
- **When to Use**: Describe when this connection should be used (critical for AI matching)
- **When NOT to Use**: Describe when it shouldn't be used
- **Example Phrases**: Add phrases callers might use (e.g., "upgrade my plan", "cancel subscription")

#### 🛡️ **Safety & Risk Tab**
- Set risk level (Low/Medium/High)
- Add risk notes for high-risk connections
- Toggle confirmation requirement

#### ⚡ **Advanced Tab**
- Set preconditions (required data before connection can be used)
- Add system prompt additions
- Add usage examples
- Add tags for organization

### 3. **Use Templates**
- Click the **book icon** in the header to see quick-start templates
- Choose from: Collect Info, Transfer, Explain Policy, Perform Action, Sensitive Action
- Templates pre-fill all the important fields for you!

### 4. **Preview Mode**
- Click the **eye icon** to see exactly what the AI sees
- This helps you understand how your descriptions will be interpreted

## 🎨 Visual Features

- **Hover Effects**: Edges glow when you hover over them
- **Professional UI**: Modern gradients, smooth animations, organized tabs
- **Visual Hints**: Helpful messages guide you
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all screen sizes

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific in "When to Use"**: The AI relies heavily on this description
2. **Add Example Phrases**: 3-5 examples help the AI match caller intent better
3. **Set Risk Levels**: High-risk connections automatically require confirmation
4. **Use Preconditions**: Ensure connections only activate when required data is collected
5. **Test with Preview**: Use preview mode to see how the AI interprets your descriptions

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Click on a connection in your workflow
2. Try a template to see how it works
3. Customize the fields to match your use case
4. Use preview mode to verify it looks good
5. Save and test!
